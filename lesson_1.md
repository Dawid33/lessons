# What is this?
This is a lesson plan made to get people up to speed on writing c code. Lessons contain practical exercises to learn by doing. The info sections contain explanations for the different parts of the lessons. Those who already know a programming language can likely skip many of the info sections.

# Lesson 0 : Setting up a basic c program
In these lesson, we will be using the software visual studio code, cmake, and a terminal. This section explains what these are and how to use them. If you already know how to compile c code or wish to use other tools, you can skip this section.

Firstly, create a file called "lesson_1.c" with the following contents :

```c
#include <stdio.h>

main() 
{
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
}
```
In order to compile the this code into a runnable application, we first need to compile it. Create a `CMakeLists.txt` file with the following content :

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0.0)
set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS 1)
project(learning-c C)

add_executable(lesson_1 "lesson_1.c")
```

This file contains instruction on how to compile our files. The details of each of the instructions will be explained later.

Next, we need to create a folder for all the files that will be generated by `cmake`. Open up a terminal in the project directory and run each of the following commands :
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
```
`mkdir` stands for "make directory" and `cd` stands for "change directory". This will create a new folder called build and move your terminal into the newly created folder. Next, we can finally compile and run the c file:
```sh
cmake ..
make
```
The `cmake ..` and `make` commands utilize the `CMakeLists.txt` file you created earlier. Running those commands should yield output similar to this :
```
[dawids@dawids-pc build]$ cmake ..

    3 | main()
      | ^~~~
[100%] Linking C executable lesson_1
[100%] Built target lesson_1
[dawids@dawids-pc build]$ 
```
`[dawids@dawids-pc build]$` is the prompt on my computer, yours will likely be different. If all went well there should now be a file called `lesson-1` in that directory. You can execute that file with the following command :
```
./lesson-1
```
The output should be :
:::success
Hello, World!

# Lesson 1 : Variables
A C program, whatever its size, consists of *functions* and *variables*. A *function* contains *statements* that specify the computing operations to be done, and variables store values used during the computation. The following code creates a single variable called x :
```c
main() 
{
    int x;
}
```

If you run this code, you'll see it doesn't output anything. The following code is more useful :

```c
#include <stdio.h>    // Import library function that allow us to print information to the terminal e.g. printf

main()                // Define the fuction main.
{                
    int x;        // Create a variable 'x'
    x = 30;           // Assign the value 30 to the variable
    printf("%d", x);  // Print the value inside the variable to the screen  
}
```
The code `int x` *declares* a variable. The line finish with a semi-colon, 

Everything after two slashes `//` is considered a comment and is not read by the compiler. Multi-line comments are written with `/* */`.


```c
/*
This is a multi-line
Comment
*/
```

:::info
In math, we talk about variables being an “unknown quantity” that you are supposed to solve for. Variables in math are a specific value that you just need to figure out.

In programming, a variable is a place in memory where you can store information. It’s like a little box or bucket to put stuff in. At any point in time, you can look up the contents of the variable or rewrite the contents of the variable with new stuff. When you do this, the variable itself doesn’t need to change, just the contents in the box.

Each variable has a name and a type. The name is what you’ll use in your program when you want to read its contents or put new stuff in it. The variable’s type indicates what kind of information you can put in it.

When you declare a variable, the computer knows that it will need to reserve a place in memory for this variable.
